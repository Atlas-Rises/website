            I recently returned from a two-week vacation deep in the hills of Tuscany, a lovely yet excruciatingly hot part of the world where I had plenty of time to lounge by the pool
            (periodically jumping in so as not to mummify in the heat) and read <i>Crossroads</i>, a novel by Jonathan Franzen.
            <br><br>

            Perhaps this indicates fault in my criteria for selecting novels, but this was the first time in quite a while where I can truthfully characterize my appetite for a book as <i>voracious</i>.
            I've thought about the reasons for my captivation, and I think there are a few. Perhaps you often find yourself captivated by similar things, in which case you may too enjoy this book! The
            very few who are familiar with my literary proclivities (congratulations, you are about to enter the exclusive cadre!) know that I love tableaus of semi-contemporary American life. <i>Crossroads</i>
            falls nicely into this category, so right off the bat, things are looking good. However, I think the real reason for this novel's allure goes deeper than this: it is the thematic focus on theology
            in a way that feels <i>uniquely human</i>. What I mean by this is that there were several moments in the book where each of the individual members of the Hildebrandt family, the novel's protagonists,
            are grappling with some personal struggle related to faith, in a broad sense, often in the form of vivid internal monologues. As I read these passages, I would think "Wow, I haven't experienced
            this particular struggle before, but reading it now, it almost feels inevitable. Like any human who grapples with religion will eventually arrive at some train of thought reminiscent of what is
            on the page". That was very cool.
            <br><br>

            <i>Crossroads</i> is fundamentally book about faith in flux. It's about the times in our life when we decide firmly that we no longer can bring ourselves to believe in something, or can no longer go on <i>without</i>
            believing something. This belief doesn't necessarily have to be religious in a strict sense: this is just the novel's backdrop for a much broader context. Maybe it is belief in someone close to us, maybe
            it is belief in some ideology or institution. Maybe it is belief in ourselves, that we have the capacity to do good things in this world. We get to see each of the Hildebrandts go through the process of
            mental anguish, to realization, to action, and finally, we get to see the consequences. The reason why religion is such a good subject to intermix with "belief at large" is not just because it is a subset,
            a type of believing, but because the Christian faith supposedly lays out a moral code that should be, at least for God-fearing people, a sort-of beacon guiding the way to arrive at the right beliefs, and
            therefore the right decisions. But, as is demonstrated repeatedly in this book, it often doesn't fulfill this purpose.
            <br><br>

            The narrative structure of this book is quite simple: there are no massive leaps between different periods of time, no instances where we have to question the reliability of the narrator, and moreover,
            most of the early chapters of the book focus on individual members of the Hildebrandt family exclusively, with their story-lines mixing to a greater degree in the novel's final act. And before I forget,
            let me comment on <i>Crossroad</i>s' final chapters: they make the story, I simply could not put the book down. I really hesitate to give too much away about the explosive conclusion of this novel, as I think
            it is best experienced reading it oneself, but I will say that something I've noticed about contemporary American literature is the focus on <i>responsibility</i>. <i>Crossroads</i> is certainly no exception...
            <br><br>

            I give this book an 8.5/10, it is very well done. Its only real flaw is that early on, some of the ideas it explores (relating to religion, for example) seem a bit derivative, but this improves drastically as the novel progresses.

            As always, thanks for reading
            J.C.
