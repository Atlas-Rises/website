#+TITLE:Love as a mirror
#+DESCRIPTION:

This goal of this piece is to provide some clarification and elaboration on a Tweet
that I sent out a little while back.

I will take this opportunity to point out that I am not a ``Rand-roid". Ironically, one part
of the objectivit philosophical canon I find myself disagreeing with most is ``The Romantic 
Manifesto", and yet I plan on invoking Rand's views on romance and love repeatedly, oft in
agreement, at least in how I interpret her words.

There is a massive difference between "allowed to do" and "ought to do".
