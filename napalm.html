            <!-- Duality in America: freedom yet protection, the freedom to be ignorant, the freedom to offload your thinking, the way that you interact with the world to a greater power -->
            <!-- In America we are free, and yet we choose to give our freedom away. We forget. Why are people in America not free? It isn't because of government or corporations, I hate this trope
                 because it just completely rejects the will of man. Maybe the will isn't strong enough to resist market forces and the latest slop that McDonalds churns out. But I don't think
                 this is what it is. I think that the root is that people don't question what they are given.

                 This also bears another question: should an experiment with the potential for abundance yet also destruction be brought to fruition? Histroy has taught us that the answer is a resounding yes.
            This is what America does very well, this is .-->

                <h3>1. Highway</h3>

                Grass clippings and tar make a disorienting perfume. The taxi was sealed shut yet, somehow, the air was sharply punctured by the odour.
                Despite his dizziness, the man in the back seat felt reassured. Knowing you're not suffocating inside of a motorized box-on-wheels puts the mind at ease.
                Your senses give you reason: carbon dioxide expelled from the lungs, replaced with oxygen drawn from beyond the tinted windows, accented with a pungent flavour
                that makes the head light.
                <br><br>

                The highway was a mess, a constant of life which brought irritatation rather than comfort. Potholes the size of footballs and automotive gridlock. They decided that in order to fix the mess,
                a bigger, temporary mess was required; a controlled mess, a mess where they could dictate the terms.
                The cement-pourers and pavement-rollers and lane-line-painters were out in
                full force, taking an inanimate glee in asserting their size and power over the rest of the vehicles on the road. To the taxi's left,
                a group of convicts scooped up trash and cut grass on the median separating
                motionless chains of cars, stretched taut up and down the interstate.
                They were bodies hunched, sunburnt skin, draped in orange jumpsuits which took on a darker shade than usual, drenched from exertion. They wielded spears and rakes,
                corralling hamburger wrappers and pages of <i>the Times</i> and bits of
                styrofoam and cardboard into waste-hoppers. A smaller group of the prisoners held weed-whackers. They sauntered up and down
                an overgrown patch on the roadside, arms swaying back and forth bearing their instruments, grass blades flung from steel blades,
                eyes squinting in the sun, surely looking for something&mdash;the man didn't know what.
                He didn't think they knew either. He imagined them in the cafeteria being fed, in the yard being watched, in their cells being shackled, forever looking without desperation.
                There isn't much to be desperate about when you know the Sun will rise on the same Earth tomorrow. <!--  [ADD STUFF HERE]-->
                The beckoning hand of reality quickly becomes invisible inside plastic worlds. The trip up the island (Long Island, a pretend island)
                took no more than an hour and a half: just the duration needed for silence in
                the man's head to reverberate the echos of such meditations. The things you see on an American highway.
                <br><br>

                Contemplation was disrupted by commotion. Barks and shouts bled into the cab, deamplified enough to scramble the words but
                still possessing the scratchy-smooth quality that let the man know whether the speaker was a heavy smoker or not. Not two cars ahead, the wheel
                of an asphalt-mixer had slipped into a drainage ditch. The other three wheels seemed eager to follow, an untimely
                gust of wind likely all the convincing they required. The driver hollered at his companions to find some chain or some rope or some what-do-you-call-it that
                connects objects in motion. His plan was to use one of the larger trucks to tow the mixer back onto level ground. The taxi lurched forward just in time to
                move beyond the disaster shockwave, the gravitational pull of chaos. Workers ran into each lane of traffic, their movement accompanied by a chorus of honking and cursing.
                They had to clear space to swing the truck widthwise across the road, and by the time cars were forced from a slow crawl to a total stop, the taxi had barely cleared the scene.
                The man craned his neck to gawk, as you have the privilege of doing when you find yourself in the midst of a disaster-flyby. The workers wore neon vests, a lighter, more artificial
                shade than the prison jumpsuits. Most were chewing on cigarettes.
                Their faces were leather stained maroon, hair tussled, shirts damp. It was one of those September days where the air is autumnal and crisp but you still sweat through your sport coat.
                <br><br>

                With catastrophe in the rear-view mirror, the man thought about how he <i>had</i> gone to a real island once before.
                Hawaii, three years ago. Not a pleasure-trip, of course, pleasure was foreign to him these days and
                Hawaii was domestic, he didn't even need his passport to get there, so of course it couldn't possibly have been a pleasure-trip.
                It surprised many people to learn that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had a field office on Oahu.
                The idea of such an absurd juxtaposition had to be planted artificially. Human traffickers lounging on the beach, drug kingpins sipping Pina Coladas poolside,
                murderers and terrorists saying "Aloha", they just couldn't understand cancer in paradise. Aside from being the most contradictory, <i>FBI Field Office, Oahu</i>
                had another claim to fame: it was the only bureau building on top of a volcano. Of course, the man saw this as a ridiculous claim, seeing as Oahu is a pretend volcano, never living
                up to the carnage and destruction synonymous with its topographical compatriots (remember St. Helens?). These technically-trues, semi-embellishments, and
                tongue-in-cheeks were nice at parties. <i>You see, the bureau, we're everywhere,
		                got intelligence officers in igloos up in Anchorage </i>(regular buildings suffice)<i>, got agents with telescopes and parabolic reflectors 
		                on the roof of the Empire State Building </i>(that one time there was a bomb threat during the New York City marathon)<i>, heck we're on top of a damn volcano</i>. 
		            Not that he would say any of these things, but he heard the director liked to amuse and intrigue 
		            whenever he was summoned to some Washington gala.

                <h3>2. Laboratory</h3>

                <!-- "Zimmerman" said the Buddhist.-->
                <!--  "FBI" said the man.-->

                <h3>3. Far Away</h3>

                They went to the diner across the road, it was the only place open at such an hour. Come dusk, neon signage becomes a
                universal beacon for the lost and weary. They were something else. The motion of Zimmerman's hand to the door handle was both automatic and apprehensive,
                like he knew they belonged, but couldn't figure out why. Past the kitchen, sliding into a booth, the two men felt submerged. The entire restaurant was muffled, like it was filled to the brim with water.
