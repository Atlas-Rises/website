                <h1>Metaphysics of the non-physical</h1>
            </center>
            <p>
                I'm almost certain that my interest in academic philosophy began with the mind-body problem, so it
                is fitting that my first piece of writing for <a href="https://atlas-rises.github.io/website"><i>Atlas, Rise</i></a> be on this subject. The idea
                for this blog post first came in summer of 2023, when I was living in Boston. I was at a <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/dojo/">Dojo house</a> barbeque,
                and as I recall, a debate about the singular importance of human conciousness in the universe (which I believe) took a turn for philosophical when we began
                discussing the physical/non-physical nature of the mind. During this conversation, I made certain arguments similar, though less refined, to some of what follows.
                All of this is to say that I would like to thank the barbeque-goers who, as a result of our idea-exchange, indirectly helped me write this piece!
                <br><br>

                To offer a succinct exposition to the unacquainted reader, the mind-body
                problem can be a posited as a "mutual inconsistency" between 4
                metaphysical claims (this treatment is due to [<a href="#1">1</a>], an excellent book that I read during my first year of university for an introductory philosophy class):
                <ol>
                    <li>The mind is non-physical</li>
                    <li>The body is physical</li>
                    <li>The mind and the body interact</li>
                    <li>Non-physical things cannot interact with physical things</li>
                </ol>
                Clearly we cannot accept all of these premises simultaneously without arriving at a contradiction, despite each seeming at least somewhat plausible.
                We are therefore tasked with resolving this inconsistency. Some of the great thinkers of human history
                have attempted solutions which, more or less, amount to simply rejecting one of these claims wholesale. One of the most notable radical examples of this is Leibniz's
                psychophysical parallelism via "pre-established harmony", which asserts that the mind and the body <i>do not</i> interact. Instead, every distinct substance interacts
                only with itself, but by the guiding hand of some divine power (God), there is a universal harmony, a pre-programmed synchronization between the independent actions [<a href="#2">2</a>].
                Perhaps I will write more about my thoughts on parallelism in a future essay, but for the time being, let me simply state that I respect the boldness of those who show no mercy, and are willing to cleave from the inconsistent list.
                There is a certain satisfaction in modes of thought which "go all the way".
                But, much to the chagrin of my desire for no-half-measures, I, like many contemporary
                thinkers who ponder the same problem, believe that a softer touch is needed in order to make progress
                towards resolution.
                <br><br>

                As the title suggests, I would like to sketch a preliminary metaphysics for the "non-physical" world. In my opinion, this first requires a discussion
                the world vs. the parts of the world that the mind can interact with. First of all, I am categorically <i>not</i> a relativist: the existence of an objective world
                is something that I completely believe, and will <i>accept</i> throughout this essay (more on this another time). However, I also believe that the aspects of the world that are <i>accessible</i>
                to reason and conceptualization in the mind form a proper subset of all phenomena. In other words,
                <br><br>

                <b>Claim 1.</b> <i>The mind is finite within the objective world. In other words, there exist phenomena in the objective world with which the mind cannot interact via conceptualization.</i>
                <br><br>

                As a "non-example", consider the UV spectrum of light, much of which lies outside the grasp of our human senses. It would be highly inaccurate to classify UV light
                as a phenomenon lying outside of "the accessible", because of the fact that we can reason about the nature of UV light: we can model its behaviour and interactions
                via physics, and observe high predictive-power of our models. The sum total of this understanding forms our <i>conceptualization</i> of UV light, and so it is accessible.

                We must also be careful to distinguish between what the mind <i>cannot</i> interact with, and
                what the mind <i>has not yet</i> interacted with. Imagine for a moment that this piece was written at the end of the 19th century instead of 2024. Albert Einstein is still a young child,
                and has not yet had even a modicum of insight about relativity or the geometric nature of gravity. Does this mean that the phenomena of "time dialation" or "curved spacetime"
                lie outside of the accessible? It does not: clearly we <i>can</i> conceptualize these ideas, but when Einstein was a boy, we simply had not <i>yet</i> done so. Applying this same logic forward in time,
                I would say it is a safe bet that there is a enormity of physics that we <i>do not yet</i> understand or access, but <i>could</i> access eventually. All such physics lies within
                the set of accessible things.

                As a final example, let us consider an example which helps to show that <i>complexity</i> of an idea or a phenomenon is independent of whether it is accessible or not.
                Consider for example a system
                <br><br>

                But what about the phenomena which <i>are not</i> accessible? A natural first question to ask is why we should even believe it to be true that non-accesible things exist.
                I think one of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting this claim emerges both from Nagel's famous work <i>What is it like to be a bat?</i> [<a href="#3">3</a>]. In this work, Nagel
                argues for what he calls the "subjective character of experience"
                <br><br>


                <b>Claim 2.</b> The non-physical is the set of all anti-concepts, things which we not only do not know, but do not have the capacity to <i>ever</i> know.
                When I say "know", I mean to conceptualize: to describe and predict with some kind of physical theory to a high degree of confidence.
