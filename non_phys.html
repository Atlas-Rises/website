            <p>
                My interest in philosophy began with the mind-body problem. So, it
                is fitting that the first piece of writing for <a href="https://atlas-rises.github.io/website"><i>Atlas, Rise</i></a> be on this subject. The idea
                for this blog post first came in summer of 2023, when I was living in Boston. I was at a <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/dojo/">Dojo house</a> barbeque,
                and as I recall, participating in a debate about the singular importance of human conciousness in the universe (a claim I strongly believe). This
                eventually evolved into a discussion about the physical/non-physical nature of the mind.
                During this conversation, I made certain arguments similar, though less refined, to some of what follows.
                All of this is to say that I would like to thank the barbeque-goers who, as a result of our idea-exchange, indirectly helped me write this essay.
                <br><br>

                To begin, a succinct exposition for the unacquainted reader: the mind-body
                problem can be a posited as a "mutual inconsistency" between 4
                metaphysical claims (this treatment is due to [<a href="#1">1</a>], an excellent, easily-digestible book that I read during my first year of university, for an introductory philosophy class).
                <ol>
                    <li>The mind is non-physical</li>
                    <li>The body is physical</li>
                    <li>The mind and the body interact</li>
                    <li>Non-physical things cannot interact with physical things</li>
                </ol>
                We cannot accept all of these premises simultaneously without arriving at a contradiction, despite each seeming at least somewhat plausible.
                We are therefore tasked with resolving this inconsistency. Some of the great thinkers of human history
                have attempted solutions which, more or less, amount to simply rejecting one of these claims wholesale. One of the most notable (and radical) examples of this is Leibniz's
                psychophysical parallelism via "pre-established harmony", which asserts that the mind and the body <i>do not</i> interact. Instead, every distinct substance interacts
                only with itself, but by the guiding hand of some divine power (God, whoever He is, according to Leibniz), there is a universal harmony, a pre-programmed synchronization between the independent actions [<a href="#2">2</a>].
                Perhaps I will write more about my thoughts on parallelism in a future essay, but for the time being, let me simply state that I respect the boldness of those who show no mercy, and are willing to cleave from the inconsistent list.
                There is a certain satisfaction in modes of thought which "go all the way".
                But, much to the chagrin of my desire for no-half-measures, I, like many contemporary
                thinkers who ponder the same problem, believe that a softer touch is needed in order to make progress
                towards resolution. And for our touch to be soft, it is first important to examine the underlying assumptions that have gone into <i>posing</i> the mind-body problem in the first place.
                With this, I ask:
                <br><br>

                <b>Question 1.</b> <i>What is the substance of the non-physical?</i>
                <br><br>

                After all, we invoke "the non-physical" as an ingredient in our formulation of
                the mind-body problem, and to me, it is the one which has taste most difficult to discern.
                <br><br>

                Towards an answer to <b>Question 1</b>, I will attempt to sketch a <i>very</i> preliminary metaphysics for the non-physical world. In my opinion, this first requires a discussion
                <i>the world</i> vs. <i>the parts of the world with which the mind can interact</i>. To preface what is to come, let me state that I am categorically <i>not</i> a relativist: the existence of an objective world
                is something that I completely believe, and will <i>accept</i> throughout this essay (more on this another time). However, I also believe that the aspects of the world that are <i>accessible</i>
                to reason and conceptualization in the mind form a proper subset of all phenomena. In other words,
                <br><br>

                <b>Claim 1.</b> <i>The mind is finite within the objective world. In other words, there exist phenomena in the objective world which are inaccessible: those with which the mind cannot interact via conceptualization.</i>
                <br><br>

                By "conceptualization", I am refering to the process in which the mind is able to assign phenomena in the world to some unifying set of mechanisms which explain and
                generalize its behaviour, to some degree of precision. Such an assignment defines a <i>concept</i>.
                For example, I see an apple falling from a tree. I may conceptualize this phenomenon by thinking "this is an instance of gravity: the curvature of spacetime due to the presence of mass". Or, I
                might see a ball being launched through the air and think "this is an instance of kinematic motion. I could use kinematic motion to predict, within 5 metres error, where a similar projectile would end up if I increased
                the launch angle by 30 degrees and the speed by 10 km/h".
                <br><br>

                Before proceeding, it is important to pause here, and internalize what is being stated in <b>Claim 1</b>.
                As a "non-example", consider light. Most light lies outside the grasp of our human senses, except for a very small subset of wavelengths that the eyes can register.
                It would however be highly inaccurate to classify phenomena which can be explained via
                the radiation spectrum (perhaps a phenomenon whose consequences I enjoyed last night: warming up some lasagna in a microwave oven) as lying outside of "the accessible".
                The reason why is clear: we can reason about the nature of light without perceiving it at a sensory level. We can model its behaviour and interactions
                via optics, and observe high predictive-power of our models. We can build a microwave oven. The sum-total of this understanding forms our <i>conceptualization</i> of "instances of light" via the abstraction of "optics".
                To summarize, there is a more general statement holding true: <i>sensory perceptibility</i> differs from <i>accessibility</i>.
                <br><br>

                We must also be careful to distinguish between what the mind <i>cannot</i> interact with, and
                what the mind <i>has not yet</i> interacted with, via conceptualization. Imagine for a moment that this piece was written at the end of the 19th century instead of 2024. Albert Einstein is still a young child,
                and has not yet had even a modicum of insight about relativity or the geometric nature of gravity. Does this mean that the phenomena (perhaps, a black hole)
                which can only be explained due to the mechanisms of "time dialation" or "curved spacetime"
                lie outside of the accessible? It does not: clearly we <i>can</i> conceptualize these things, but when Einstein was a boy, we simply had not <i>yet</i> done so. Applying similar logic forward in time,
                it is probably a safe bet that there is a enormity of phenomena with behaviour a consequence of physics that we <i>do not yet</i> understand or access, but <i>could</i> access eventually. All such phenomena lie within
                the set of accessible things.
                <br><br>

                As a final point, I would like to stress that the <i>true underlying complexity</i> of a phenomenon is independent of whether it is accessible or not.
                Consider for example what happens when we throw a ball through the air. A very simple approximation of the corresponding physics is kinematic motion, with no air reisistance, on a flat Earth
                (sorry engineers and physicists, I may be giving you flashbacks). This model is often very accurate, but it of course does not perfectly replicate the true motion of the ball. We
                can, if we wish, write down increasingly more complicated models, with exponentially diminishing returns in the time-old headache/accuracy tradeoff (i.e. we can consider the shape of the ball,
                the air resistance, the curvature of the Earth, etc...but I'm just so damn tired...). Some models may be more useful than others, but all are valid ways to conceptualize the phenomenon of this
                ball flying through the air. We don't require an <i>exact</i>
                model of a phenomenon to say that we have conceptualized it: Newton certainly had a conception of phenomena like apples falling from trees via his theory of gravity,
                even though his theory turned out to be an approximation of general relativity,
                which we observe to describe more phenomena, more accurately. In fact, it may very well be true that gravity is not fully described by general relativity, but once again, this doesn't change the fact that "gravity"
                forms a concept about which we can think and reason.
                Our conceptualizations can broaden and improve over time.
                <!-- This line of reasoning may seemingly lead to a fatal flaw in the preceeding argument: "if all that is required for conceptualization -->
                <br><br>

                But what about the phenomena which <i>are not</i> accessible? A natural first question to ask is why we should even believe in the <i>existence</i> of non-accessible things? If we were to find that the set of all
                non-accessible phenomena is empty, then we are led against our will (well, my will, at the very least) to <i>physicalism</i>. For the reason why, see <b>Claim 2</b>, but before going there, it is worthwhile
                to argue at this point why non-accessible phenomena do indeed exist. I think one of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting this claim is an idea which emerges from Nagel's
                famous work <i>What is it like to be a bat?</i> [<a href="#3">3</a>]. In this work, Nagel
                argues for what he calls the "subjective character of experience". To clarify his thinking, he poses a thought-experiment, where he asserts that it is
                possible for a human to imagine navigating by sonar, hanging in caves, and eating insects, just like a bat
                does, but our experience would be that of "a human behaving and living like a bat" rather than the actual perspective of a bat, so no matter what, we will always be missing an
                understanding of <i>some</i> aspect of the bat's experience. "Subjective character of experience", I believe, constitutes an example of a <i>non-accessible phenomenon</i>.
                After all, if one <i>could</i> access the mechanism which gives rise to "subjective character of experience", then it seems reasonable to believe that one could use such a mechanism truly have the concious experience of a bat, which
                Nagel argues against extensively in his work (yes, I am being slightly lazy here, and passing the torch off to Nagel to let him do my arguing for me, but don't they say something about "standing on the shoulders of giants"?....).
                <br><br>

                I'll now state my second claim, probably the most important of this work:
                <br><br>

                <b>Claim 2.</b> <i>The non-physical world is the set of all anti-concepts, things which we do not have the capacity to <b>ever</b> conceptualize.
                    Said differently, The non-physical is made up of everything for which we cannot ascribe some set of mechanisms, such as a theory of physics, allowing us to conceptualize the "thing".</i>
                <br><br>

                This is more of a definition than a claim. The main work that remains is to demonstrate that this definition is contradiction-free.
                <br><br>

                One point of pushback that I have heard from multiple people is the disbelief that the non-physical world is "closed". Humans have not always existed: we evolved into what we
                are today. Moreover, it is reasonable to think we will change far into the future. Maybe we will even augment our brains with computers, and become cyborgs (as God surely intended, if He's out there).
                As a result, how can one say that the non-physical world is what the mind can never conceptualize? If the mind always changes, then the non-physical world always changes. The way that I think this concern
                is resolved is by "accepting" the premise that the physical and the non-physical world cannot interact. In particular, processes like evolution can change the conditions in which cognition must operate, but not the
                mind itself. The analogy I like to use in this situation is that of a man swimming in a trecharous river rapids. Things like evolution and brain-computer
                augmentation (also being drunk, being a baby, suffering brain injuries, etc.) change the physical characteristics
                of the river rapids: they add rocks, they change the direction of current, weakining it to a smooth flow or strengthening it to an extent where it is impossible not to drown. But, the mind itself, the man, is
                independent of these conditions: he will just have to respond to them in different ways, to the best of his abilities. Sometimes changes in conditions will help him swim in the direction he is going, and
                sometimes they will completely prevent him from making any progress. Sometimes he will sink into the deep and never emerge. The point of this analogy is to say: changes in conditions will not change the
                mind itself.
                <br><br>

                Another important question can now be posed: is the <i>mind itself</i> non-physical? Unfortunately, the framework provided here does not provide much of an answer. 
                <br><br>

                <i>Thank you for reading. I will likely write more, expanding on some of these ideas....or perhaps I'll reject them after more reflection, both outcomes are plausible. Either way, I'll let you know. - J.C.</i>
